**Need to Understand Javascript SCOPE and PARAMETER passing. By Friday of next week.
String is an array of characters. (Within "")
All JS functions need a name and (){} -> function functionName(){}
A script tag can see every element on a page that it is written to.
And are bound to the page they are located.
DOM (Document Object Model)
document.getElementById("btnSubmit").addEventListener("click", [function Name]);
String Literals get " "
Variables Do not when within parenthesis.
Global Variables are BAD! they can be seen across the page.
Do not define a Global Variable but only if you need to use one.
In general we want everything contained in a function.
